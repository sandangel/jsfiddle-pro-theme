# JSFiddle Pro - For Presentation

## A new light theme inspired by JSFiddle syntax color.

Dark theme is great when you're coding. But when you need to show your work, a demo to someone else, presenting at a conference, or just making Video record for teaching, a light theme would be a solid choice. Black text on white background is just easier to read for people.
